# Organizational Profile
Defence  for  children  Sierra  Leone  (DCI-SL)  is  a  Sierra  Leonean  chapter  for  Defence  for  Children 
International. 
DCI-SL was founded in 1998 as an independent non-profit and non-governmental organisation dealing with 
juvenile justices, gender issues, child’s rights and human rights mainstreaming and advocacy. The main thrust 
of DCI-SL work is to provide socio-legal support to children in conflict with the law, children and young adult 
victims  of  human  rights  abuse/violations,  and  those  at  high  risk  of  vulnerability  e.g.  street  children,  girl 
prostitutes,  girl  mothers,  and  children  without  proper  caregivers  or  not  attending  school.  Community 
Mobilization for women access and ownership to land for the availability and affordability of food for children

To accomplish this goal DCI-SL focuses on the following target areas:
- Juvenile Justice

movement, it has regional offices that are almost autonomous which develop its own 
programmes and seeks its own funding for its programmes both locally and internationally.
