# CODE QUALITY FOR HTML
1. Strict DOCTYPE
2. Character Set &amp; Encoding Characters
3. Proper Code Indentation  
Indentating code can be defined as the way you follow to organize and document your source code. If we follow proper style guide and indentation then a program can be just like a POEM. And the reader will be comfortable enough to SAIL through it and understand the meaning. As we know a proper code indentation will make it:
a. Easier to read
b. Easier to understand
c. Easier to modify
d. Easier to maintain
e. Easier to enhance

4. Keep Our CSS And JavaScript External
5. We Will Nest Our Tags Properly
6. Eliminate Unnecessary Divs
7. We will use Better Naming Conventions
8. We are going to leave Typography to the CSS
9. We are going to use strict Class/Id where necessary
10. We will Validate the code : Validation will be done on [online](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) platform
11. Will ensure Logical Ordering
12. We will Just Do What we Can to get things right


# CODE QUALITY FOR CSS

1. DRY
- DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself". We are going to apply the DRY principle to avoids repetition, decreases the number of lines, and improves readability and even performance
2. NAMING
- We are going to use better name convention for selectors because of self-descriptive and readability.
3. We Dont Use Inline-Style
- In my opinion, the best practice is actually not using inline styles.
4. Avoid the !important tag
- This is not good because CSS rules can differ from one selector to another, from parent selector to child.
5. We will use a Preprocessor
- Working with a CSS Preprocessor like **Sass** is very useful in bigger projects. A preprocessor brings additional features to our CSS code that we normally can't do. 
6. We are going to use Shorthands
- Some of the CSS properties like paddings, margins, fonts and borders can be written in a much simpler way by shorthands. Using shorthands helps to reduce the lines of rules.
7. Add Comments When Necessary
- Normally, quality code doesn't need comments because it should already be clear and self-descriptive. But still, in some cases, we may need to write additional explanations.
